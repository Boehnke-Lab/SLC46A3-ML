# Version 1:
- Place both the code and the xlsx file of the dataset in the same folder and run the code.

	  1. concentration of different lipids
	  2. one-hot encoding with different lipid labels
	  3. one-hot encoding with different head group and tail group labels
- Next, the code let's you choose additional columns in your feature matrix - material and physicochemical parameters
	- Enter the ones you require using the assigned numbers separated by comma
- The output of the code will be an excel file named with the type of processing and whether you've added additional features.
- The new excel file will be created in the same folder as your code.
